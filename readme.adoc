## Build and run

  ./gradlew build
  java -jar build/libs/*.jar F P

## Thoughts

### what's unspecified and / or  inconsistent:

 - once in a million (of what?) patients (all? dead?) or simulations?
 - change state != only one rule can be applied. diabetes
 - monster rule is applied even after another rule

### a few ways of handling deadly rule first:
    - manual ordering
    - apply all rules. easiest to extend, computationally most expensive
    - runtime fail fast (as a result expect not state but wrapper that throws exception when gets DEAD state)
    - static: remove dead from state enum. none programmer will ever make a mistake but requires a bit more complex architecture

### possible DSL
        Healthy.with(Insulin, Antibiotic).becomes(Fever)
        when(Healthy).gets(Insulin, Antibiotic).becomes(Fever)
        when(Diabetes).gets(Insulin).becomes(Diabetes).otherwise(Dead)

### possible improvements

- debugging. each rule could have a label / description so that
it's easier to trace which rule kicked in
